#+Title: Portable Media User Manual
* Introduction
  The user manual is for conducting a workshop using portable media.
* Known Issues
  - Videos will not be loading from Open edX platform.
    In the next release, we will resolve this problem
* Steps for portable-media setup
  - Be ready with the system with following machine specs
    + *Intel i7* processor or *Intel Xenon (Rack/server grade Version)*
    + *16 GB RAM* minimum 
  - Be ready with the Wifi router
    + Configure WiFi-Router ::  Router has to serve 10.2.57.0/24 to
         its clients. That means we have to configure LAN settings in
         router such that router's dhcp server will serve IPs from the
         above IP range to its clients.
  - Take a LAN cable and connect it to machine. This connection has to
    come from router only. *Do not touch WAN port*
  - Take the HDD (portable-media)
  - Boot the machine from portable-media through USB
  - User credentials to log into the machine
    + User name :: Virtual-Labs
    + Password :: admin123
  - Run the following command on terminal to run virtual labs on
    OpenedX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch platform.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd vagrant-boxes
    vagrant-boxes$vagrant up           #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
    
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - Virtual labs are ready in our machine , we are ready to use the
    labs

* Steps for conducting a workshop
  - Admin/Workshop coordinator user will be using this portable media machine setup.
** OpenVZ web panel
   - Use the link http://localhost:3000
   - It will ask for the user name and password, provide following
     credentials
     + User Name :: admin
     + Password :: admin

   This web panel is for managing virtual-labs which are running on
   localhost(Portable media). Each lab has one OpenVZ container. * By
   default, all lab containers are stopped*. But, server nodes will be
   in running state( We have to keep them running). 

   - NOTE :: *Please don't play around the portable media setup unless
             you know what you are doing*. 
   - Server nodes are 
     |------+--------------------------+------|
     | S.No | Conatiner Name           | CTID |
     |------+--------------------------+------|
     |    1 | Router                   | 1001 |

     |   10 |                          |      |
     |------+--------------------------+------|
     We can stop ADS (1009) and Config-server (1002).

   - Once you are logged into web panel,
     + Look for =localhost= on left side of the panel and Click on
       =localhost=
     + Then you will be seeing all labs running on OpenVZ
       containers(stopped and running)
*** How to start Lab containers
    - Go to OpenedX platform http://open-edx.vlabs.ac.in
    - Select the course/lab that you want to take for the
      workshop. And remember the lab name
    - Go to http://localhost:3000 and Sign into =OpenVZ web panel= 
      + Use following user credentials
        User name : admin,    Password : admin
    - Click on localhost located at left side of the panel
    - Search for the lab name that you have selected in the Second
      step.
    - Then, choose that lab by clicking on CTID (ex.213) and look for
      =change state= button on the panel, and select =start=
      + If you face any problem, try starting container again.
*** Limitations on starting lab containers for better results
    + If you are using server grade machine/system *(>=32 GB RAM,
      Intel Xenon processor)*
      - You can start all lab containers (that are stopped).
    + If you are using *Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM
      machine/system*, 
      - In this kind of machine, Maximum 5 simultaneous users can
        access one lab at a time.
      - Please start the labs which are needed for the workshop.
      - The best choice is start one lab at a time and maximum of 4
        labs.
       
** Nagios 
   It is for monitoring systems resources such as load on the machine,
   RAM usage, Processes, etc.
   - Use the link http://localhost/nagios
   - User credentials are
     + User Name :: nagiosadmin
     + Password :: admin123
		   
** Change your DNS servers settings
   Workshop coordinator has to give following instructions to lab users
   - Lab user can access the labs through LAN cable and also over
     wireless. LAN cable should be connected to WiFi-router.
   - Once the user is connected to wireless or LAN, user has to modify
     their *DNS servers* 

     + *Linux*  
       - Open the file
         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
         #+END_EXAMPLE
       - Delete existing entries and add the following line
         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
         nameserver 10.2.57.64
         #+END_EXAMPLE
     + *Windows*
        *Example: Changing DNS server settings on Windows 7*

        - Go to the Control Panel.
        - Click Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center >
          Change adapter settings.

        - Select the connection for which you want to configure Public
          DNS. For example:
          + To change the settings for an Ethernet connection,
            right-click Local Area Connection > Properties.
          + To change the settings for a wireless connection,
            right-click Wireless Network Connection > Properties.
    
        - Select the Networking tab. Under =This connection uses the
          following items=, select =Internet Protocol Version 4
          (TCP/IPv4)= or =Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)= and
          then click Properties.
        - =Select Use the following DNS server addresses=. and add =10.2.57.64=
        - Desable wifi connection and enable wifi again.
       
** Set No Proxy on browsers
   - Once the lab users got connected to wifi, lab user has to unset
     proxy if any proxies used previously( Set =No Proxy=) in their
     browsers . For example, In firefox, 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Firefox --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Network --> Settings 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
** Analytics and Feedback 
*** How workshop coordinator will fetch and share the analytics feedback logs?
    1. Workshop coordinator will be given a shell script.
       + Login as =vlabs= user to machine using following credentials
	 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 username: vlabs
         password : admin123
 	 #+END_EXAMPLE
       + Login as root using following credentials
	 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 su -
	 password : admin123
	 #+END_EXAMPLE
       + Then run the following script
         #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 sudo sh /root/workshop-anlytics/fetch_analytics.sh <InstituteName>   #InstituteName should not have spaces.
         #+END_EXAMPLE
       
         The above script will get the dump of analytics and feedbacks
         and saves as =<InstituteName>.tar.gz=
    2. Workshop coordinator to send out the compressed log file
       =<InstituteName>.tar.gz= and
       share it on email (engg@vlabs.ac.in)
*** How engg@vlabs.ac.in will restore logs?
    1. Download the compressed zip file and decompress it.
    2. Copy the compressed zip file in ELK-analytics server.
    3. Execute a simple python script which reads from this log file
       and writes data to elasticsearch.
